## Description

This application is an employee management application that allows any user to add, view, and remove departments, roles, and employees in various different manners.

The reason for creating this challenge was to learn more about using MySQL, using queries with index.js, and using inquirer.js combined with MySQL queries.

I was able to learn everything I listed above, and look forward to using MySQL both in future projects and in the field when I hopefully find a job.
